headingText: (Optional) Add pre-built resources

After deploying this integration, you can add these pre-built resources:

* A default **set of pre-built alert policies**. This is a default set of recommended alerts conditions that you can add to your account. These conditions are grouped into a policy called <DNT>**Kubernetes alert policy**</DNT>. Once added, you can customize the [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/) to meet your needs. See [Recommended alert policies](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/recommended-alert-policies) for more information about managing them.

* **Pre-built dasboards**. Follow these steps to add pre-defined dashboards:

  1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Integrations & Agents**</DNT>. 

  2. Select <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> to access the pre-built resources. 

  3. Search <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT> and select the dashboard you want to add.

  5. Click <DNT>**Setup Kubernetes**</DNT> or <DNT>**Skip this step**</DNT> if you already setup this datasource.

  6. Click <DNT>**View dashboard**</DNT>, and see your Kubernetes data in New Relic.
